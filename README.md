# cw-01-if-statements

Exercise 2
(6 minutes)

- x = 8
- y = 0
- a = 'Hello!'
- b = ''

Team up with a partner. Decide who is the driver and who is the navigator. Now, write a program that compares two variables and prints out statements accordingly. Start here:

Check if x and b are both True. If they are, print "Both x and b are true"
Check if y or a is False. If one is, print "Either y or a is false"
Check if either x or y is False. If one is, print out "Either x or y is false"
Then, only if either x or y is False, check if x is greater than y. If it is, print out "x is greater than y"
Hint: Put another if statement inside the first if statement!
